        <div class="projectintro"><p>I am writing a 5000 word report on the Political spectrum. More specifically how the political spectrum is represented in modern media and the bias represented by those media on certain wings/ideologies on the spectrum. My report Includes Studies from Parlgov as well as political commentary from political scientists such as Cas Mudde. The current progress is around 3500 words and I am writing a section labeled 'Where is the centre' in which I am discussing the fact that certain articles/sources claim to be unbiased but portray heard to notice opinion that can easily sway the reader's opinion on the same matter.</p></div>
