        <div class="projectdiv"> <h4> Here are some of the codes I have previously worked on, Bare in mind that these will be very simple in output since they are decomposed problems that will be put together to complete my NEA. They all play a part(if a small one) in helping me finish out the project and thus I have decided that they are important enough to display.</h4></div>
        <div class ="projectdiv"><p>All code can be found in greater depth <a href = "https://github.com/KotletCodes?tab=repositories">Here</a>, Please feel free to update/ improve it in any way as you see fit. At the bottom of the page you can find a roadmap for my progress.</p></div>

        <div class="projectintro"><h2>WPF based Login system</h2><h3>This project began as a plan for my NEA(more info in the NEA tab), This project contains three pages, the main page with a login and registration button. The registration feature involves the programme writing the username and password to a text file seperated by a "-" which allowed for easy reading during the login part which used the streamreader function and iterated through a list of all passwords saved on the file. It also uses a break; keyword to ensure that the foreach loop stops running if the right password is found.</h3><image src = "Screenshot 2025-02-18 162137.png" class="projimg"></image></div>
        <div class ="projectintro"> <h2>Arduino stepper motor control using serial port</h2><h3> In this project I connected a c# based winform form with a serial port connection and controlled the movement of a motor from said page.The Hardware I used was an arduino mega, a nema 17 stepper motor and a an4988. Again this is a shorter project that will be implemented in a more complex depth in my NEA.

        <div class = "projectintro"><h2>Air defence system mock</h2><h3>In this project I used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor to create a mockup of an air defence system. The sensor is mounted to a nema-17 stepper motor and carries out a certain amount of steps(x amount of steps). After, the x value of steps is multiplied by -1, which then makes the next motion of the motor be in the opposite direction.Thus creating a perimiter to scan. The sensor has been calibrated and coded in a way that it measures distance between itself and the object directly infront of it in cm. Thus, a simple if statement can be created to create the solution to the project. If an object comes within a certain distance of the sensor, stop rotating and aim at the object(Lock in as an air defence system would).</h3><video width="640" height="120" controls>
